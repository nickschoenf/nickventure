# NICKVENTURE

NickVenture was originally written in Visual Basic as a rip-off of ClickHole's ClickVenture, out of annoyance with their user interface. There are currently three completed NickVenture games to be re-written in Rust and reorganized now that I am a better programmer and a better man. I hope I make you proud. I know you're watching.
